    <h3>Latest Project</h3>
    <p>My project develops an AI-powered smart ring that packs clinical-grade health monitoring into a sleek, screen-free wearable. By leveraging Machine Learning, the ring doesn't just track steps; it predicts illness, detects sleep apnea, and offers personalized recovery coaching through pattern recognition of heart rate and skin temperature.
Technically, I am integrating a flexible PCB and a multi-sensor suite (PPG, thermistors, and 6-axis motion sensors) into a titanium-alloy shell. The result is a durable, IP68 waterproof device that provides 7–10 days of battery life while delivering actionable health insights without the distraction of a smartphone screen.</p>
